# MeetingPrepAI
Meeting prep AI - negotiation tactics, talking points, brief

The "Meeting Preparation AI" project aims to streamline the preparation process for meetings by leveraging artificial intelligence to analyze email threads and meeting transcripts. This AI system will automatically generate concise and informative summary reports from the discussions and correspondence leading up to a meeting. By doing so, it ensures that all participants are well-informed and can engage effectively during the meeting itself.

## Key features of the Meeting Preparation AI include:

Just upload meeting transcripts or email threads in a .pdf or .txt file and it will generate a summary as per the below outline. Do not give any prompt. The prompt is optimized to generate a summary in 4 sections. 

Section 1: Key features about the product being discussed

Section 2: Overall discussion agenda and participants list.  

Section 3: Key takeaways with important quotes from participants. 

Section 4: Overall sentiment analysis and pain points.

Section 5: Further action points or suggestions based on the conversation analysis. 

 

Above is the default output without any prompt. If the user wants to include a specific section they can further modify the output by giving a prompt.
